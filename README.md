Hi sarah,
For Ansible roles, you can see your Ansible course from Kodekloud


Push your terraform( VPC, EC2, S3) code to GitHub
Provision EC2, VPC, and S3  bucket using Terraform. Please follow the best practices of Terraform
Write GitHub action (CI/CD) to provision the infrastructure on AWS
Also, destroy the provisioned infrastructure using the GitHub action after the below points will be done
Connect to provisioned EC2 instance from local and run ansible role to install nginx docker and docker-compose. Each ansible role should be separate for each installer
Write a separate role that will change the nginx port from 80 to 81
